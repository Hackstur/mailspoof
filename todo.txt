## To Do

* Travis build on tagged commits and push to pypi

* Docker image for people who don't have python 3.7

* Add rules for `aspf` and `adkim`.

* Add logging

* Handle DNS NoAnswer, add options for timeout from CLI

* make an alias Scan() -> scan() so we can do mailspoof.scan()
mailspoof.spfscan()
mailspoof.dmarcscan()
